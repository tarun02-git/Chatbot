# Chatbot
1. Project Overview
This project implements a chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models (LLMs), and the LangChain framework. The chatbot answers user queries by leveraging a vector database to retrieve context-relevant knowledge and generates responses through a language model (e.g., GPT-4). The system ensures accurate, context-driven answers by combining external knowledge sources with the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

2. Key Components
OpenAI LLM:

Model: GPT-4
Role: Generates human-like responses to user queries based on retrieved knowledge.
Configuration: Temperature set to 0.5 for balanced creativity and accuracy.
LangChain Framework:

Simplifies integration between LLMs and the vector store.
Provides tools for constructing prompts and chaining inputs/outputs effectively.
RAG Architecture:

Combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches.
Retrieves relevant chunks of information from a knowledge base and uses them as input to the LLM.
Vector Database: ChromaDB

Stores document embeddings for efficient similarity-based retrieval.
Supports flexible and scalable retrieval of context-relevant knowledge.
Gradio Interface:

Provides an intuitive UI for user interaction with the chatbot.
Includes live response streaming and maintains conversation history.
3. Implementation Workflow
Data Preparation:

Documents or knowledge base content are embedded using OpenAIâ€™s text-embedding-3-large model.
Embeddings are stored in ChromaDB for efficient retrieval.
Retrieval Process:

User queries trigger a similarity search in ChromaDB, fetching the top k relevant document chunks.
Retrieved chunks form the external knowledge base for the query.
Prompt Construction:

A custom prompt is dynamically generated with:
The user query.
Retrieved knowledge chunks.
Conversation history (for context).
Response Generation:

The constructed prompt is passed to the GPT-4 model.
The model generates responses solely based on retrieved knowledge, ensuring factual accuracy.
UI/UX:

The Gradio interface manages user inputs and displays chatbot responses.
Supports a conversational format and intuitive messaging layout.
4. Features
Knowledge-Aware Responses:
Responses are grounded in the retrieved knowledge, minimizing hallucination.
Live Response Streaming:
Partial responses are displayed as the model generates them.
Rate Limit Handling:
Implements retry logic with exponential backoff to handle OpenAI API rate limits.
Scalable Knowledge Base:
Easily expandable by adding more documents to the vector database.
5. Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries/Frameworks:
LangChain
Gradio
OpenAI API
ChromaDB
dotenv (for environment variable management)
6. Challenges Faced
Rate Limits:
Resolved by adding exponential backoff and retry logic.
Efficient Document Retrieval:
Optimized vector store queries using appropriate embedding models and fine-tuned similarity search parameters.
Prompt Engineering:
Ensured that the language model adheres strictly to external knowledge without relying on internal biases.
7. Results
A functional chatbot that accurately answers user queries using an external knowledge base.
Real-time response generation with a user-friendly interface.
Scalable architecture for larger datasets and more complex queries.
